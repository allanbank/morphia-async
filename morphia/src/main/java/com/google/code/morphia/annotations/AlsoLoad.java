/**
 * Annotation which helps migrate schemas by loading one of several possible
 * properties in the document into fields or methods. This is typically used
 * when a field is renamed, allowing the field to be populated by both its
 * current name and any prior names.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>When placed on a field, the additional names (document field) will be
 * checked when this field is loaded. If the document contains data for more
 * than one of the names, an exception will be thrown.
 * <li>When placed on a parameter to a method that takes a single parameter, the
 * method will be called with the data value. As with fields, any ambiguity in
 * the data (multiple properties that would cause the method to be called) will
 * produce an exception. However, {@code @AlsoLoad} on a method parameter *can*
 * be used to override field names and "steal" the value that would otherwise
 * have been set on a field. This can be useful when changing the type of a
 * field.</li>
